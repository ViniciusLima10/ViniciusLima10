### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vinicius Lima, I am 17 years old and started to learn code seriously in the beginning of the covid quarantine, though I began learning python in 2019 through my cousin's indication, who is a senior developer. I am not working at any company at this moment. Currently doing the CS50 course from Harvard and the Next Level Week #2 from Rocketseat. I like technologies, games and TV shows.

Hope you like me
